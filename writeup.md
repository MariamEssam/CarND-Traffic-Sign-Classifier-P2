**Overview**
In this writeup I am going to discuss my project and any experience I accquire during working in it.

##**Dataset Summary & Exploration**
###**DataSet Summary**
The data set is composed from three main parts:
1.Training data (samples = 34799)
2.Validation data (samples =4410)
3.Test data(samples =12630)

The data given is already separted so no need to split the data

##**Exploratory Visualization**
In this section I tried to display a rabdom sign to see what will be explored

Also I checked the distribution of the train as shown below and as a quick remark I had some of the train data repeat alot while others are really rare this distribution is not good......
